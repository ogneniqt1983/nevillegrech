Just the text I am writing right now.
e file specified by dest is opened in the append mode, each source file is added to the end of the destination file, one after the other. Note that the temp array is static duration (meaning itâ€™s allocated at compile time, not each time the append() function is called) and block scope (meaning that it is private to the function).
The example uses text-mode files; by using the "ab+" and "rb" modes, it could handle binary files.
